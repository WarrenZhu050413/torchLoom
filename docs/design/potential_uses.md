# Potential Uses for torchLoom

This document collects ideas for how the torchLoom infrastructure could be extended or applied in other projects.

- Integrate with HPC schedulers to reassign GPUs on failure without restarting jobs.
- Use the mapping layer to implement elastic scaling, allowing replicas to join or leave during training.
- Broadcast optimizer or data loader changes from a central tuning service for automated experiments.
- Connect external health monitors that predict GPU failure and preemptively migrate workloads.
- Leverage JetStream history to replay training events for debugging or teaching purposes.
