# Interactive Model Training with torchLoom

This document outlines the vision for interactive model training, how torchLoom's architecture enables this paradigm, and potential next steps and applications.

## 1. The Vision of Interactive Model Training

Interactive model training is about enabling human-in-the-loop intervention and dynamic adjustment during the training process. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where:

*   **Compute is Constrained:** Maximize insights and performance from a fixed computational budget, potentially outperforming traditional hyperparameter sweeps.
*   **Problem Definition is Fluid:** Address situations where the training landscape is complex, the state space is unconstrained, or unforeseen events can occur (akin to challenges in quantitative trading).
*   **Real-time Adaptability is Key:** Allow for immediate adjustments based on observed model behavior rather than waiting for the completion of lengthy, predefined training runs.
*   **Targeted Data Sampling/Curriculum Learning:** Dynamically guide the training process by, for example, having the model sample more data points from areas where it is underperforming.
*   **Rapid Algorithm Application & Recovery:** Enable the application of new research ideas or recovery strategies (e.g., from sudden loss spikes) without the need to restart or wait for standard checkpointing cycles.

**Considerations:**
*   While interactive adjustments can lead to "p-hacking," if overfitting is carefully managed, this paradigm can yield significantly more useful data and faster convergence to desired model behaviors.

## 2. How torchLoom Enables Interactive Training

torchLoom's architecture provides the foundational infrastructure necessary for the real-time monitoring and control that interactive model training demands.

## 3. Potential Next Steps & Applications

Building upon torchLoom's interactive capabilities, several promising avenues can be explored:

*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent Training:**
    *   The interactive paradigm is well-suited for RL, where an agent's learning can be closely monitored and guided. As noted, "In RL: You can define a much better transition state," suggesting that interactive adjustments could significantly refine the training of RL agents.
*   **Advanced Model Checkpointing and Versioning (e.g., `git-theta`):**
    *   Investigate tools and techniques like `git-theta` for managing and tracking changes to model weights and configurations that arise from interactive training sessions. This could provide better reproducibility and understanding of how interactive adjustments impact model evolution.
*   **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
    *   Use the interactive loop to more intuitively and rapidly explore hyperparameter spaces.
*   **Curriculum Learning:**
    *   Interactively adjust the data presented to the model or the complexity of the tasks it's trying to solve, guiding its learning process more effectively.
