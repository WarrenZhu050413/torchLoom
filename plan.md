# Plan for Updating TODO and Suggesting Additional Features

## Goal
Enhance TODO.md with more detailed tasks for runtime configuration features beyond learning rate and incorporate the PyTorch Lightning integration.

## Steps
- Review existing TODO.md and controller/runtime code for context.
- Identify new adjustable parameters that could be controlled via JetStream messages.
- Update TODO.md with bullet points describing the new runtime control features, the Lightning integration via callback or context manager, and clearer instructions for each item.
- Keep the style of bullet points (no numbering) per AGENTs instructions.
- Commit the plan and the updated TODO.md.
